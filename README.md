## Motive

When developing the program, a topic was selected with a focus on solving the current discomfort. The team members sympathized the most with the difficulty in studying English words, so the design was based on the content.

Methods to study actual English words were collected and designed as functions. I tried using DataBase and utilized the desired function more efficiently.

<br>

## Introduce

A screen that allows you to add/search/check the wrong answer word at any time, a screen that allows you to retake the test with only the wrong answer word, and a screen that shows the contents and test results that you can take the test regardless of whether or not you have an incorrect answer, and a schedule while learning It consisted of a screen showing words repeatedly over time. It is composed of separate .java according to the details.
